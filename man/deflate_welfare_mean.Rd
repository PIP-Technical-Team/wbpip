}
\arguments{
\item{welfare_mean}{numeric: The weighted welfare mean from a survey.}

\item{ppp}{numeric: PPP value}

\description{
Adjust the welfare mean of a survey to constant PPP-adjusted dollars to make
surveys comparable over time and across countries.
}
\details{
Note that the CPI value to be used must be pre-adjusted so that welfare
aggregates are comparable across surveys within a given country. This implies
that adjustments to account for temporal and spatial factors within the
survey as well as currency changes between surveys must already have been
made.
