Description: The goal of wbpip is to twofold. First it contains the 
    methodological formulations currently used by the World Bank to 
    estimate and monitor global poverty and to calculate cross-country
    and time comparable socioeconomic measures. Second, it provides a
    suit of user-friendly functions that allows anybody to estimate 
    poverty and inequality measures with their own data, using the 
    methodological approach of the World Bank.
