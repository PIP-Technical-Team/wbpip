# wbpip

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `{wbpip}` is to twofold. First it contains the methodological formulations currently used by the World Bank to estimate and monitor global poverty and to calculate cross-country and time comparable socioeconomic measures. Second, it provides a suit of user-friendly functions that allows anybody to estimate poverty and inequality measures with their own data, using the methodological approach of the World Bank.  


## Installation

You can install the released version of wbpip from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("wbpip")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("PIP-Technical-Team/wbpip")
```

# Basic end-user workflows
Basic workflows are based on single data files (micro- or grouped-data).
The assumption for these workflows is that they can be satisfied by feeding a 
single micro- / grouped-data file to different functions.

## Single stats
* `get_poverty_rate(df, povline)`
  `compute_poverty_rate(welfare, weight, povline)`
* `get_number_poor(df, povline, pop)`
* `get_poverty_gap(df, povline)`
* `get_poverty_severity(df, povline)`
* `get_watts_index(df, povline)`
* `get_mean(df)`
* `get_median(df)`
* `get_gini(df)`
* `get_polarization(df)`
* `get_mld(df)`
* `get_quantile(n = 10)`

# Multiple stats
* `get_distributional_stats()`
* `get_poverty_stats()`


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(wbpip)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
